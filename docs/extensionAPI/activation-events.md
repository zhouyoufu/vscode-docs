PageTitle: Visual Studio Code Activation Events - package.json
DateApproved: 5/4/2017
MetaDescription: To support lazy activation of Visual Studio Code extensions (plug-ins), your extension controls when it should be loaded through a set of activation events in the package.json extension manifest file.

# Activation Events - package.json

Extensions are activated lazily in VS Code.  As a result you need to provide VS Code with context as to when your extension should be activated.  We support the following activation events:

* [`onLanguage:${language}`](/docs/extensionAPI/activation-events.md#activationeventsonlanguage)
* [`onCommand:${command}`](/docs/extensionAPI/activation-events.md#activationeventsoncommand)
* [`onDebug:${type}`](/docs/extensionAPI/activation-events.md#activationeventsondebug)
* [`workspaceContains:${toplevelfilename}`](/docs/extensionAPI/activation-events.md#activationeventsworkspacecontains)
* [`*`](/docs/extensionAPI/activation-events.md#activationevents)

We also provide an overview of the [`package.json` extension manifest](/docs/extensionAPI/extension-manifest.md) and the minimum required fields.

## activationEvents.onLanguage

This activation event is emitted and interested extensions will be activated whenever a file that resolves to a certain language gets opened.

```json
...
"activationEvents": [
    "onLanguage:python"
]
...
```

## activationEvents.onCommand

This activation event is emitted and interested extensions will be activated whenever a command is being invoked:

```json
...
"activationEvents": [
    "onCommand:extension.sayHello"
]
...
```

## activationEvents.onDebug

This activation event is emitted and interested extensions will be activated whenever a debug session of the specified type is started:

```json
...
"activationEvents": [
    "onDebug:node"
]
...
```

## activationEvents.workspaceContains

This activation event is emitted and interested extensions will be activated whenever a folder is opened and the folder contains a top-level file.

```json
...
"activationEvents": [
    "workspaceContains:.editorconfig"
]
...
```

## activationEvents.*

This activation event is emitted and interested extensions will be activated whenever VS Code starts up. To ensure a great end user experience, please use this activation event in your extension only when no other activation events combination works in your use-case.

```json
...
"activationEvents": [
    "*"
]
...
```

> **Note:** An extension can listen to multiple activation events, and that is preferable to listening to `"*"`.

> **Note:** An extension **must** export an `activate()` function from its main module and it will be invoked **only once** by VS Code when any of the specified activation events is emitted. Also, an extension **should** export a `deactivate()` function from its main module to perform cleanup tasks on VS Code shutdown. Extension **must** return a Promise from `deactivate()` if the cleanup process is asynchronous. An extension may return `undefined` from `deactivate()` if the cleanup runs synchronously.
