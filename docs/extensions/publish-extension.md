# Publishing Extensions

## vsce - Publishing Tool Reference

[vsce](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsce) is the command line tool you'll use to publish extensions to the [Extension Marketplace](/docs/editor/extension-gallery.md).  You can also load extensions locally and share them via email or a UNC drive.

## Installation

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then run:

```
npm install -g vsce
```

## Usage

You'll use the `vsce` command directly from the command line. For example, here's how you can quickly publish an extension:

```
$ vsce publish
Publishing uuid@0.0.1...
Successfully published uuid@0.0.1!
```

For a reference on all the available commands, run `vsce --help`.

## Publishing Extensions

Visual Studio Code leverages [Visual Studio Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-team-services-vs) for its Marketplace services. This means that authentication, hosting and management of extensions is provided through that service.

`vsce` can only publish extensions using [Personal Access Tokens](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/2015-jul-7-vso.aspx). You need to create at least one in order to publish an extension.

### Get a Personal Access Token

First, make sure you have a [Visual Studio Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/get-started/setup/sign-up-for-visual-studio-online) account.

In the following examples, the account name is `monacotools`. From your account's home page (eg: `https://monacotools.visualstudio.com`), go to the **Security** page:

![Security page](images/publish-extension/publishers1.png)

Click **Add** to create a new Personal Access Token:

![Add personal access token](images/publish-extension/publishers2.png)

Give the Personal Access Token a nice description, optionally extend its expiration date to 1 year, make it access every account and set the authorization to **all scopes**:

![Personal access token details](images/publish-extension/publishers3.png)

The next screen will display your newly created Personal Access Token. **Copy** it, you'll need it to create a publisher.

### Create a Publisher

A **publisher** is an identity who can publish extensions to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. Every extension needs to include a `publisher` name in its [`package.json` file](/docs/extensionAPI/extension-manifest.md).

Once you have a [Personal Access Token](/docs/extensions/publish-extension.md#get-a-personal-access-token), you can create a new publisher using `vsce`:

```bash
vsce create-publisher (publisher name)
```

`vsce` will remember the provided Personal Access Token for future references to this publisher.

**Note:** Alternatively, create your publisher in https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage and login in `vsce`, as described in the next section.

### Login to a Publisher

If you already created a publisher before and want to use it with `vsce`:

```bash
vsce login (publisher name)
```

Similarly to the `create-publisher` command, `vsce` will ask you for the Personal Access Token and remember it for future commands.

You can also enter your Personal Access Token as you publish with an optional parameter `-p <token>`.

```bash
vsce publish -p <token>
```

## Auto-incrementing the Extension Version

You can auto-increment an extension's version number when you publish by specifying the [SemVer](http://semver.org/) compatible number to increment: `major`, `minor`, or `patch`.

For example, if you want to update an extension's version from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0, you would specify `minor`:

```bash
vsce publish minor
```

This will modify the extension's `package.json` [version](/docs/extensionAPI/extension-manifest.md#fields) attribute before publishing the extension.

You can also specify a complete SemVer compatible version on the command line:

```bash
vsce publish 2.0.1
```

## Packaging Extensions

You may want to package extensions without publishing them to the store. Extensions will always be packaged into a `.vsix` file. Here's how:

```bash
vsce package
```

This will package your extension into a `.vsix` file and place it in the current directory. It's possible to install `.vsix` files into Visual Studio Code. See [Install from a VSIX](/docs/editor/extension-gallery.md#install-from-a-vsix) for more details.

### Sharing Privately with Others

If you want to share your extension with others privately, you can send them your packaged extension `.vsix` file.

## Visual Studio Code Compatiblity

When authoring an extension, you will need to describe what is the extension's compatibility to Visual Studio Code itself. This can done via the `engine.vscode` field inside `package.json`:

```json
{
  "engines": {
    "vscode": "^1.8.0"
  }
}
```

A value of `1.8.0` means that your extension is compatible only with VS Code `1.8.0`. A value of `^1.8.0` means that your extension is compatible with VS Code `1.8.0` and
onwards, including `1.8.1`, `1.9.0`, etc.

You can use the `engine.vscode` field to make sure the extension only gets installed for clients which contain the API you depend on. This mechanism plays well with the
Stable release as well as the Insiders one.

For example, imagine that the latest Stable version of VS Code is `1.8.0` and that during `1.9.0`'s development a new API is introduced and thus made available in the Insider release through version `1.9.0-insider`. If you want to publish an extension version which benefits from this API, you should indicate a version dependency of `^1.9.0`. Your new extension version will be installed only on VS Code `>=1.9.0`, which means all current Insider customers will get it, while the Stable ones will only get the update when Stable reaches `1.9.0`.

## Advanced Usage

### Marketplace Integration

You can customize how your extension looks in the Visual Studio Marketplace. See the [Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/lukehoban.Go) for an example.

Here are some tips for making your extension look great on the Marketplace:

- A `README.md` file at the root of your extension will be used to populate the extension's Marketplace page's contents. `vsce` will modify README links for you in two different ways:
  - If you add a `repository` field to your `package.json` and if it is a public GitHub repository, `vsce` will automatically detect it and adjust the links accordingly.
  - You can override that behavior and/or set it by using the `--baseContentUrl` and `--baseImagesUrl` flags when running `vsce package`. Then publish the extension by passing the path to the packaged `.vsix` file as an argument to `vsce publish`.
- A `LICENSE` file at the root of your extension will be used as the contents for the extension's license.
- A `CHANGELOG.md` file at the root of your extension will be used as the contents for the extension's changelog.
- You can set the banner background color by setting `galleryBanner.color` to the intended hex value in `package.json`.
- You can set an icon by setting `icon` to a relative path to a squared `128px` PNG file included in your extension, in `package.json`.

Also see [Marketplace Presentation Tips](/docs/extensionAPI/extension-manifest.md#marketplace-presentation-tips).

### `.vscodeignore`

You can create a `.vscodeignore` file to exclude some files from being included in your extension's package. This file is a collection of [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) patterns, one per line.

For example:

```
**/*.ts
**/tsconfig.json
!file.ts
```

You should ignore all files not needed at runtime. For example, if your extension is written in TypeScript, you should ignore all `**/*.ts` files, like in the previous example.

**Note:** Development dependencies listed in `devDependencies` will be automatically ignored, you don't need to add them to the `.vscodeignore` file.

### Pre-publish step

It's possible to add a pre-publish step to your manifest file. The command will be called every time the extension is packaged.

```json
{
    "name": "uuid",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "publisher": "joaomoreno",
    "engines": {
        "vscode": "0.10.x"
    },
    "scripts": {
        "vscode:prepublish": "tsc"
    }
}
```

This will always invoke the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) compiler whenever the extension is packaged.

## Common Questions

**Q: I get 403 Forbidden (or 401 Unauthorized) error when I try to publish my extension?**

**A:** One easy mistake to make when creating the PAT (Personal Access Token) is to not select `all accessible accounts` in the Accounts field dropdown (instead selecting a specific account). You should also set the Authorized Scopes to `All scopes` for the publish to work.

**Q: I can't unpublish my extension through the `vsce` tool?**

**A:** You may have changed your extension ID or publisher name. You can also manage your extensions directly on the Marketplace by going to the [manage page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage).  You can update or unpublish your extension from your publisher manage page.

**Q: Why does vsce not preserve file attributes?**

**A:** Please note that when building and publishing your extension from Windows, all the files included in the extension package will lack POSIX file attributes, namely the executable bit. Some `node_modules` dependencies rely on those attributes to properly function. Publishing from Linux and OS X works as expected.
