# VS Code Extension Examples

## Tools to Help you build an Extension

Tool|Purpose
----|-------
**[Extension Generator](/docs/extensions/yocode.md)**|To help you getting started implementing an extension, we have a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator.  This creates all the initial settings you need for the development environment to work well and includes the API Typing files and any relevant modules.  You can find the generator source code [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-generator-code).
**[Debugging Extensions](/docs/extensions/debugging-extensions.md)**|We have worked hard to provide an easy way to develop, debug and locally test your extensions.
**[Publishing Tool](/docs/extensions/publish-extension.md)**|Once you have a working extension, it's time to share it in the [extension Marketplace](/docs/editor/extension-gallery.md). We have a simple command line tool for this. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsce).
